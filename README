This is just a little something I created for my undergraduate 
final year project. Its a neural network library used for supervised 
learning. It uses backpropagation with gradient descent for learning 
and handles overfitting to some degree with L2 regularization.

This project is made up of two parts;
ArduinoNeuralNet (A minimized neural network library) - To be used on the arduino platform.  For installation instructions please harness the power of google.

The rest - Which is the work horse of the whole darn thing. With this, 
you can create and train a multilayered feed-forward neural network. 
For my convenience (sorry), it is able to generate arduino code 
containing the structure and content (weights and biases) of the 
network after training for embedding. Its been tried and tested on 
Linux (Ubuntu).

ArduinoNeuralNet depends on the awesome library, StandardCplusplus, by 
maniacbug. Install it alongside. 

There is only one example at the moment, i.e. in main.cpp. But I'll 
add more really soon.
