This project is a Neural Network library created as a counterpart to 
the ArduinoNeuralNet. This library is used to create programs that are 
used to create and train Neural Networks for use on the Arduino 
platform. Although it could be used in any program that make use of 
C++. It was also used as a project to learn how to use the git VCS. 
Suprisingly, git is really awesome!
